django-schemulator is a project that started in 2014 inspired by an idea by Ashley
Camba Garrido and whose coding was started by Carlos de las Heras as his first 
open-source python library coding project.

Here is a (hopefully ever-growing) list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who have submitted patches, reported bugs, added translations, helped
answer newbie questions, and generally made django-schemulator much better:
